# Mantaflow #

Mantaflow is an open-source framework targeted at fluid simulation research in Computer Graphics.
Its parallelized C++ solver core, python scene definition interface and plugin system allow for quickly prototyping and testing new algorithms. 

In addition, it provides a toolbox of examples for deep learning experiments with fluids. E.g., it contains examples
how to build convolutional neural network setups in conjunction with [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

For deep learning with fully differentiable fluid simulations, please check out our [phiflow framework](https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow).
